      <h1>Why adopting?</h1>
      <h2>Euthanasia Rates</h2>
      <p>
        Shelters are often overcrowded, and many animals are euthanized due to lack of space and resources.
        By adopting, you directly contribute to reducing euthanasia rates and giving a deserving animal a second chance at life. 
      </p>

      <h2>Combating Overpopulation</h2>
      <p>
        Adoption helps to alleviate the problem of pet overpopulation, as each adoption frees up space in 
        shelters and reduces the number of animals entering the system. 
      </p>
        
      
      <h2>Spaying and Neutering</h2>
      <p>
        Many shelters spay or neuter animals before adoption, which helps control the pet population and
        prevent unwanted litters
      </p>

      <h2>Companionship</h2>
      <p>
        Pets provide unconditional love and companionship, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation. 
      </p>
    </div>
